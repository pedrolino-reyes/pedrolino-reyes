- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @pedrolino-reyes
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in developing and testing software
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Spring Boot with Java, using Karate for testing. And I'm doing an MSc in Computer Science and Cyber Security with the University of York.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me? I've got loads of different email addresses. For strangers, try my university email address: jjq519@york.ac.uk
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: Pete Reynolds isn't actually my official name, I'm just trying it out. My registered name is Peter Loggie. Which do you prefer?!
